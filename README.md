# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

The Fake Store API is a free and reliable API designed for building and testing e-commerce websites or applications. It provides easy access to sample data, making it perfect for prototyping or developing front-end applications without needing a real backend.

Cart Functionality
The API also offers cart management functionalities:

You can retrieve carts, add products to a cart, and simulate cart actions without impacting real data. This is useful for testing cart-related features in your application.

This API is ideal for developers who need sample data for creating e-commerce applications without the overhead of setting up a database. You can explore more about it and access the documentation on the Fake Store API website.

This cart has the calculation part to execute the product quantity, the product price, the discounted price, and the final price after applying the discount.
